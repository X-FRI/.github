## Introduction
WiscKey is a persistent LSM-tree-based key-value store with a performance-oriented data layout that separates keys from values to minimize I/O amplification. The design of WiscKey is highly SSD optimized, leveraging both the sequential and random performance characteristics of the device.

## Build and Test

- Build: `dotnet build`
- Publish: `dotnet publish -r [platform]`
- Test: `dotnet test`

## Dependencies
- The implementation of SkipList uses [DataStructures/SkipList.cs](https://github.com/sphinxy/DataStructures/blob/master/DataStructures/SkipList.cs)
