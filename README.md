*WiscKey based Key-Value Store implementation in Rust*

__WIP: This project is developed in [The X-Files Research Institute](https://github.com/X-FRI/Suka)__

</div>

## Introduction
WiscKey is a persistent LSM-tree-based key-value store with a performance-oriented data layout that separates keys from values to minimize I/O amplification. The design of WiscKey is highly SSD optimized, leveraging both the sequential and random performance characteristics of the device.
