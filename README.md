## Parser
Using the pre-compiled MySQL ANTLR parser from [Apache ShardingSphere](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/) to parse SQL, tokenize the inputs, create the domain object, and send it to the Query Engine. 

Parser will supports:
- SELECT
- CREATE
- INSERT
- DELETE
- UPDATE
- DROP

## Query Engine
The query engine abstracts all the downstream interactions. Query Engine internally calls Parser to parse the SQL statements and convert it to Domain objects. The Domain Objects are then used by the Query Planner to create a query execution plan based on some rules or heuristics. The Query Plan is executed by the Execution Engine. The Execution engine talks to Storge Engine by scanning disk files and reading the table records. These records are then send back to Query Engine via Iterator Pattern. The Query Engine applies filters based on Selection and Projection Operators defined in the Query Plan and finally sends it back to the CLI for printing the table output.

## Storage Engine
WiscKey is a persistent LSM-tree-based key-value store with a performance-oriented data layout that separates keys from values to minimize I/O amplification. The design of WiscKey is highly SSD optimized, leveraging both the sequential and random performance characteristics of the device.
