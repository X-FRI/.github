> LSM-Tree based Key-Value Store implementation in F#

</div>

This is a learning project with well-commented and readability-first code design goals, 
After the project completes the proof-of-concept phase, it will be re-implemented using OCaml, and the OCaml version will focus on performance.

## Build and Run
- Build: `dotnet build`
- Run: `dotnet run --project FsmDB`
- Test: `dotnet test`
